					<strong>MEANS AND EXTENT OF EXERCISING THE RIGHT TO USE THE SOFTWARE (LICENCE)</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The Licensor grants the Software licence to the Licensee as a non-exclusive licence.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Licensee acquires the licence once the total of the Licensor&#x2019;s licence remuneration has been paid (Clause 5.1) and once a so-called Software licence key has been provided (Clause 10.2). The licence is provided for a period of seventy (70) years from the acquisition of the licence according to the previous sentence. In the case of the &#x201c;Rented&#x201d; variant of the Software the licence is provided for the time hereof or for the period of time, for which a valid licence key is provided, depending on which is shorter; that does not affect the eventuality of a licence renewal and a new licence key issue.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Licensee may use the Software only for a purpose implied by this Agreement and in accordance with the function of the Software.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Licensee is entitled to use the Software by making a copy (installations) and by making the Software accessible to the public via the Internet (without territorial limitation). The Licensee is entitled to make a copy of the Software which is necessary for uploading and saving a web presentation in a computer &#x2013; server memory, as well as for displaying, running and transmitting on the Internet, and for the purpose of making a web presentation accessible to the public; the extent of this use by the Licensee is dependent on the variant of the Software under the conditions specified below.
							<ol>
								<li>
									The &#x201c;Web Site&#x201d; variant of the Software allows the Licensee to use the Software to run one (1) web presentation on one (1) server.
								</li>
								<li>
									The &#x201c;Server License for 10 Sites&#x201d; variant of the Software allows the Licensee to use the Software to run ten (10) web presentations on one (1) server.
								</li>
								<li>
									The &#x201c;Server Small Business License for 50 Sites&#x201d; variant of the Software allows the Licensee to use the Software to run fifty (50) web presentations on one (1) server.
								</li>
								<li>
									The &#x201c;Server License for Unlimited Sites&#x201d; variant of the Software allows the Licensee to use the Software to run an unlimited number of web presentations on one (1) server.
								</li>
								<li>
									For the purposes of this Agreement, a web presentation is a web presentation with a&#x00a0;defined purpose run on one domain of one level (without so-called sub-domains) and listed within the Software in a list of websites as one item. In the event that there are more alternative domain names (aliases) for a domain address directed to the same web presentation, the Licensee can request that the Licensor extends the authorisation to these other domain names.
								</li>
								<li>
									For the purposes of this Agreement, one server means one physical server (one piece of hardware) or in the event that a copy of the Software is run in an environment known as the &#x201c;cloud&#x201d;, one virtual server.
								</li>
								<li>
									In case that the Licensee ceases to use the Software for the purposes of running of any of the listed web presentations, there shall exist no right of the Licensee to use the Software to run a different web presentation instead of the terminated one. Thereby the total number of web presentations that are allowed to be run by the Software (according to the variant selected and purchased by the Licensee) shall be decreased permanently by number of once run and then terminated web presentations. An actual web presentation is considered terminated (and a new one is considered to be set up and run) also in case when the Licensee changes the defined purpose of the actual presentation in a material way, i.e. by more than 40 % during a period of 12 months. In case of doubts the Licensee is obliged to approach the Licensor to discuss the idea of partial or total change of the web presentation&#x2019;s defined purpose. Opinion of the Licensor regarding the scope of the intended change shall be decisive. Potential Licensee&#x2019;s disagreement with the opinion of the Licensor shall not affect the Licensee&#x2019;s obligations arising from this Contract until this matter is finally settled by the respective body.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							In each instance when a variant of the Software called &#x201c;Additional Servers in a Web Farm&#x201c; is provided, the Licensee is entitled to use the Software on an additional one (1) server (Clause 3.4.6) providing that the Licensor makes accessible via this server a web presentation identical to the one made accessible via the original server.
						</li>
						<li>
							For the purposes of development or testing of a web presentation or for the purposes of a&#x00a0;so-called staging server (i.e. up to the moment when a web presentation containing the Software is communicated to the public) the Licensee may install the Software on more than one computer. The limitations set out in Clause 3.4 are not applicable in this case.

						<li>
							The Licensee may not provide rights forming part of the licence, whether wholly or partially, to a third party without a prior written consent of the Licensor (grant sub-licences).
						</li>
						<li>
							The Licensee is entitled to use the Software for administration of web presentations of third parties in which the client owns at least 50% of assets (&#x2018;<strong>Subsidiary</strong>&#x2019;). Clause 3.11 of this Agreement is not hereby affected.
						</li>
						<li>
							In the case of the &#x201c;Server Small Business License for 50 Sites&#x201d; variant of the Software, the Licensee is entitled to use the Software for development and administration of web presentations of third parties providing that the Licensee secures the development and administration of such a web presentation for such a third party.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Licensee may make backup copies of the Software if this is necessary in order to use the Software properly. The Licensee shall with due care protect such copies against misuse.

								<li>
									The Licensee shall be entitled to modify the Software;
								</li>
								<li>
									The Licensee shall with due care protect the source code against misuse;
								</li>
								<li>
									In the event that rights and obligations arising from this Agreement are assigned to a&#x00a0;third party according to Clause 8 of this Agreement, the Licensee shall delete or destroy all copies of the source code of the Software which are available to the Licensee. The Licensee&#x2019;s right to use the Software in a compiled form for their personal needs under the conditions laid down by Clause 3.15 of this Agreement is not hereby affected.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							If the Licensee is not provided with the source code of the Software according to Clause 3.13 of this Agreement, the Licensee shall not by any means translate, process, alter or otherwise modify the Software, with the exception of those parts of the Software code which are provided to the Licensee in the form of a source code and are marked as such by the Licensor.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the Licensee assigns rights and obligations arising from this Agreement to a third party according to Clause 9 of this Agreement, the Licensee shall be entitled to continue to use the Software exclusively for its own use. In such an event, the Licensee shall thus not be entitled to use the Software by communicating it to the public via the Internet (in particular to run web presentations).
						</li>
						<li>
							If the Licensor hotfixes or updates the Software and in case that upgrades of the Software are provided to the Licensee a licence is provided to this modified Software too.
						</li>
						<li>
							The use of the source code is bound to the use of the License and the source code cannot be sold or transferred independently without the license for which it was purchased.
						</li>
						<li>
							Licensee hereby confirms that Licensor provided him with licence conditions of open-source solutions used within the Software and that the Licensee acquainted himself with those licence conditions and agrees with their content.

					<strong>LICENSOR&#x2019;S SUPPORT SERVICES - TECHNICAL SUPPORT</strong>
					<ol>
						<li>

For the avoidance of doubt this means that in case when the Licensee requests provision of support, but has not paid remuneration for the provision of support services in the pending Service Period and/or remuneration for the provision of support services in any of the preceding Service Periods, the Licensor starts to handle such request only after the Licensee pays remuneration for the provision of support services for both the pending Service Period and all the preceding Service Periods for which the Licensee has not paid the remuneration, including the increase of the remuneration pursuant to Clause 5.2 of this Agreement.
